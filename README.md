# LLM-Ops-for-generative-AI

## Assignment Overview

This assignment involves showcasing an end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) Operations (LLM Ops) Generative AI (GenAI) application.
The goal is to build and demonstrate a production-ready LLM system that encapsulates the full lifecycle of a GenAI application.
The system should address key aspects of LLM Ops, including data preparation, model training, deployment, and user interaction,
providing a seamless and operationally robust workflow.
